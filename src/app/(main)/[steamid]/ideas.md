# Ideas for stats page

## Player info

-   Player pfp (steam) on the left, two piece of tape holding it
-   Player name (steam) on the right (clickable to steam profile)
-   Player tagline depending on achievement for getting to:
    -   level 2 (ach_reach_level_2)
    -   level 5 (ach_reach_level_5)
    -   level 10 (ach_reach_level_10)
    -   level 20 (ach_reach_level_20)
    -   level 30 (ach_reach_level_30)
    -   level 40 (ach_reach_level_40)
    -   afterwards we look at ach_reach_level_40_count, with taglines for values 2, 3, 4, and 5
-   Number of missions finished (ach_open_loot_crates) (technically counts loot crates opened, but that's the same thing)
-   Last seen using these weapons (equipped_primary, equipped_secondary, equipped_grenade, equipped_melee)
